# Intelligent Video Summarization with Contextual Understanding

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates an intelligent video summarization system that uses Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to generate concise summaries of video content. The system extracts key frames from the video, converts speech to text, and summarizes the text to provide a brief overview of the video.
